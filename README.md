# Timeline
Timeline using Chronoline.js (http://stoicloofah.github.io/chronoline.js/) library which includes JQuery (http://jquery.com/), gTip2 (http://qtip2.com/) , and Raphael (http://raphaeljs.com/).

Using Data Visualization With Javascript by Stephen A. Thomas to make a compelling timeline that uses JavaScript to reveal timely narratives to users. This shows, effortlessly, a visual evolution of time while adding more content than a normal pie chart or bar graph.
